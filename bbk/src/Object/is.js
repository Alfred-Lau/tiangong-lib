Object.is  çš„ polyfill



Object.is() determines whether two values are the same value. Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

both undefined
both null
both true or both false
both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
both the same object (means both object have same reference)
both numbers and
both +0
both -0
both NaN
or both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value
This is not the same as being equal according to the == operator. The == operator applies various coercions to both sides (if they are not the same Type) before testing for equality (resulting in such behavior as "" == false being true), but Object.is doesn't coerce either value.

This is also not the same as being equal according to the === operator. The === operator (and the == operator as well) treats the number values -0 and +0 as equal and treats Number.NaN as not equal to NaN.
